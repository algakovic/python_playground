# Functions Practice: Building a Calculator

## Introduction 

In this project, I create a simple calculator which can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division depending on the user input.

## Objectives

This project will get me to:

- Use a while loop 
- Incorporate input/output functionality in code to allow for user interaction  
- Declare and use a function with arguments 
- Use break and continue to add control flow to a while loop
